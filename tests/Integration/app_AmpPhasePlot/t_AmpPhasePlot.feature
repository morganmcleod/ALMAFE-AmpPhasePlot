Feature: Verify AmpPhasePLot command-line options

    Scenario: Import and make plots from a power time series
    Given an amplitude time series data file on disk
    And we want to show the plots
    When the data is loaded and the plots generated
#    Then the time series plot exists
#    And the spectral plot exists
#    And the amplitude stability plot exists
